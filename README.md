## Basic operators in python
### Arithmatic operators:
Arithmatic operators are used to perform mathamatic operations like addition and subtraction. There are seven arithmatic operators that are used in python:

Addition(+)

subtraction(-)

Multiplication(*)

Division(/)

Modulus(%)

Floor Division(//)

Exponent(**)
### Relational operators:
Relational operators are used to compare two values.
There are various relational operator in python.

Less than(<)

Greater than(>)

Less than equal to(<=)

Greater than equal to(>=)

Equal to(==)

Not equal to(!=)

### Logical operators:

Logical operators are used to specify that a given condition is true or false. There are three logical operators in python:

AND: return true if both values are true otherwise false.

OR : returns true if one value is true from both.

NOT: invert the value.

### Bitwise operator:

Bitwise operator convert decimal value into binary, perform operation on bits and convert anser back into decimal.

AND(&)

OR(|)

XOR(^)

NOT(~)

Left shift(<<)

Right shift(>>)
### Assignment operator:

Assignment operator in python is used to assign a value to a variable.There are various assignment operator in python:

Simple Assignment(=)

Addition(+=)

subtracion(-=)

Multiplication(*=)

Modlus(%=)

Division(/=)

Floor div(//=)

AND(&=)

OR(|=)

xor(^=)

### Identity Operator:

Identity operator is used compare locations of the objects in memory not values of the objects.
there are two identity operator in python "is" and "is not".

### Membership operators:

Mmebership operator are used to chack that a value is present in a sequence or not. Two membership operator in python are "in" and "in not".

### Ternary Operator:

It is a way to used conditional statement in one line.

Syntax: (statement if true if condition else statement if false)
## any and all in python
any() fuction returns true if any element is True, and false if all elements are false in the iterable.
all() fuction returns true only if all elements are true in the iterable otherwise it returns false.

### Logical and bitwise not operator:

logical not operator works with boolean value on the other hand bitwise not operator works with integar value.
## Inplace and standard operator in python

Standard operator created new object and store th eresult of operation. it works with mutable and immutable both objects. Inplace operator modify existing object without creating new one. It works with only mutable objects.
## Operator functions in python

Operator function in python are special functions that privide alternative way to perform operations. In python there are many oparator functions:

add(), sub(), mul(), truediv(), floordiv(), mod(), pow(), eq(), ne(), lt(), le(), gt(), ge(), and(), or(). not().
## Inplace operator | Set 1

Inplace operator modify existing object without creating new one. Inplace operators in python are:

iadd(), isub(), imul(), itruediv(), imod(), iconcat().
## Logic gates in python
### AND Gate:
AND gate gives output of 1 if both the two inputs are 1 otherwise 0.
### OR Gate:
OR gate gives output of 1 if one or both of the input are 1 otherwise 0.
### NOT Gate
NOT gate inverts the input if input i 1 it gives 0 and if there is 0 it gives 1.
### XOR Gate
XOR gate gives an output of 1 if both inputs are different it gives 0 if both are the same.

## a += b is not always a = a + b
a += b is an inplace operator which modifies existing value of a and after modifying assign vale back to a.
a = a + b is an assignment operator. it performs addition operation and assign the result to new abject.
## Difference btw == and is operator

== is an equal operator that is used to comparing two values. "is" is an identity operatr which is used to check the identity of object.
